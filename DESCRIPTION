Package: globalSeq
Version: 1.9.1
Title: Global Test for Counts
Description: The method may be conceptualised as a test of overall significance
    in regression analysis, where the response variable is overdispersed and the
    number of explanatory variables exceeds the sample size. Useful for testing for
    association between RNA-Seq and high-dimensional data.
